Week 1(January 12): 
    This week marked the initiation of planning for the 'CoopCart' projectâ€”an application designed to simplify grocery management and ordering for cooperative living spaces. Our goal is to create an intuitive platform that meets the distinctive requirements of both individual members and kitchen managers with efficiency and simplicity.
    We delineated the application's functionalities and completed the MVP document, capturing the project's vision and anticipated outcomes. Moreover, we developed wireframes to provide a visual representation of the website's interface. We also wrapped up the API endpoint planning phase.

Additionally, we achieved a breakthrough in our backend development by completing the first endpoint, which has been thoroughly reviewed and is now in a satisfactory state for merging. This marks a pivotal step forward in our project development.
