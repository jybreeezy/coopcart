2.2.24

- began front end work on signup flow and editing user information, ran into some blocks around conflicting CSS from other team members
- set up front end auth: explored redux/RTK but ultimately went with standard implementation due to time constraints. (Shifting RTK to stretch goal)
- learn: How to connect complexity of project scope to a sense of work-hours. Could have down-scoped our backend and used more time on front end work.

  1.26.24

- finished individual endpoints
- added backend auth to user endpoints (WIP - still need to test logic to restrict get_all_users by to logged in KM by property)
- learn: formatting of inputs and outputs in endpoints, how to troubleshoot, use row_factory

  1.19.24

- created all data tables
- created first endpoint (user POST)
- assigned remaining models & endpoints out as issues to team
- learn: need to _either_ drop tables or delete volumes (interchangeable) when editing data tables --> there are cases when dropping tables alone didn't work. Deleting volumes is safest.

  1.12.24

- completed MVP, wireframes, and API endpoint documentation
- cloned repo down, created docker containers
